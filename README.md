# Cooking Recipe CLI App

## Overview

This project is part of a Python course. The goal is to create a **cooking recipe application** that runs in the command-line interface (CLI).

## Features

- Exercise 1: Set up project and added a sum-calculation script
- Exercise 2: Created a **dictionary** for each individual recipe. Those recipes are stored in a **list**. The reason for choosing these data structures are:
  - A **dictionary** provides the opportunity to store multiple features of each recipe object. It allows for organizing these features in a structured way and accessing them from other parts of the application. The recipes can also be easily modified and expanded. Additionally, dictionaries offer fast lookups for recipe attributes, which can enhance the performance of the application. They also support nested structures, allowing for complex data representation if needed.
  - A **list** lets me store multiple dictionaries. Members of a list are easily accessible and modifiable. Lists maintain the order of recipes, which can be useful for iterating through them in a specific sequence. They also provide methods for adding, removing, and manipulating the stored dictionaries efficiently.
